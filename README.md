# 🐦 2D Unity Game – Flying Bird Clone

Welcome! This repository showcases my **first 2D game project in Unity**, inspired by the classic "Flappy Bird" mechanic. I developed this game while following the [Unity Tutorial for Complete Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM), and it served as an essential introduction to Unity's core concepts and C# scripting.

## 🎮 About the Game

This is a simple side-scrolling game where a bird flies through gaps between obstacles. While it may seem basic, building this game from scratch taught me a lot about **game development fundamentals**.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Unity Editor Basics**: Understanding the four key panels – *Hierarchy*, *Scene*, *Inspector*, and *Project*.
- **GameObjects & Prefabs**: Creating, modifying, and reusing prefabs for obstacles and game elements.
- **Physics & Collisions**: Applying gravity, handling collisions, and adding Rigidbody2D and Collider components.
- **Camera Control**: Adjusting the main camera to follow the player and manage the game view.
- **Scripting in C#**: Writing Unity scripts to:
  - Spawn and destroy objects at timed intervals.
  - Detect off-screen objects and clean them up to manage memory.
  - Handle input and control player movement.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Implementing basic UI elements like score counters and game over messages.
- **Game Loop & Flow**: Managing game states and transitions like start, play, and game over.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

This project is a stepping stone, and in the future, I hope to:
- Add animations and sound effects
- Polish the UI and menu system
- Optimize performance for mobile deployment
- Build more complex games using what I’ve learned
